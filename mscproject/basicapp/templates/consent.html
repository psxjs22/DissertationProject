                        As part of my degree, I have made an educational tool to help people to identify fake news in the media, and I would like to get feedback about it and how it might be improved.<br>
                        I am doing this as part of my MSc Computer Science degree at the University of Nottingham.

                    This will take about 20 minutes in total and can be done online.
                    There will be an initial questionnaire which will ask you to provide some basic demographic information about yourself, and you will then be provided with a series of news stories and will be asked to identify which ones are real and which ones are fake.
                    I will then ask you to complete a tutorial, which aims to inform you about different strategies used by those producing fake news, and different ways to detect it.
                    There will be a follow-up questionnaire which will ask you to repeat the initial quiz in which you were asked to identify fake news articles to assess the impact of the educational tool.
                    There will be an optional debriefing questionnaire, which will ask about the useability of the webapp and the usefulness of the solution.
