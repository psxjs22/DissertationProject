      "authenticity": "fake",
      "explanation": "This article is inaccurate. \n\nWhile the story uses credible sources and figures to back up their statement, if you look carefully, the charity states that referrals to Barnardo's fostering services have increased, while those looking to become foster carers has fallen.\n\nWhile these figures are likely correct, they do not necessarily mean that the number of children needing foster care has risen by the stated amount, as Barnardo's are not the only organisation to receive referrals.\n\nThis means that while their figures may reflect wider trends, it’s impossible to draw the conclusion that the number of children needing foster care has increased by 44%.\n\nBy looking at government statistics for the years 2019-2020, it is possible to see that the number of children in care increased from 78,140 to 80,080 - an increase of 2% - and the number of children starting to be looked after reducing from 31,770 to 30,970 - a decrease of 3%.

Furthermore, evidence for the role of borax in improving bone health comes from a single 1897 study which studied the use of boron supplements (one substance found in borax) on perimenopausal women, however, the study didn’t seem to measure any actual bone loss.\n\nFor a full explanation, please see the fact checked article here: [https://fullfact.org/online/carrots-tesco-chernobyl/](https://fullfact.org/health/borax-toxic-arthritis-inflammation-hormones/)"
