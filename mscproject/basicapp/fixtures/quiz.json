      "explanation": "This is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous claim. Borax is recognised as “toxic to reproduction” by the European Chemical Agency and can also cause a number of side effects including stomach problems, headaches and dizziness and if consumed in particularly large quantities it can also cause kidney failure and even death. The scientific evidence supporting claims that borax has an anti-inflammatory effect in humans comes from a very small evidence base, based in test tube and animal studies under specific environmental conditions. Furthermore, evidence for the role of borax in improving bone health comes from a single 1897 study which studied the use of boron supplements (one substance found in borax) on perimenopausal women, however, the study didn’t seem to measure any actual bone loss.
